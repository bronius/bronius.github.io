It has taken 25 years as a non-career-chasing software developer and 5 months of unrequited searching for applicable, sustainable, senior engineer positions to free myself to explore an active, defined career path. When I began exploring the title `Product Manager`, I immediately felt so confident, comfortable, and genuinely excited to be able to full apply all my talents and skills in the workplace. Looking back over my professional journey, I see that I've always enjoyed a common thread of highly engaging cross-functional teams, customer support, requirements gathering and story writing, ideating, roadmap and backlog refinement, selling vision, DX/UX/UI satisfication engineering, and LOTs of communication.
